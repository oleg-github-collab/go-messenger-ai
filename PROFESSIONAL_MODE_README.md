## 🤖 AI Notetaker Flow

```
1. User starts meeting → 100ms connects
2. Enable transcription → 100ms live captions API
3. Transcript segments → Sent to /api/analyze-transcript
4. AI analyzes → Category, urgency, recommendations
5. UI highlights → Color-coded transcript entries
6. User clicks → Shows AI recommendation modal
7. Meeting ends → Export full transcript + bookmarks
```

### Categories
- **Pricing** (red) - Price objections, budget concerns
- **Objection** (orange) - Negative statements, pushback
- **Agreement** (green) - Positive affirmation, commitment
- **General** (blue) - Neutral conversation

## 🔐 Security

- **WebRTC Encryption**: End-to-end for media
- **Token-based Auth**: JWT tokens with expiration
- **Webhook Signatures**: HMAC verification
- **CORS Protection**: Configured for your domain

## 📊 100ms Free Tier Limits

- **10,000 video minutes/month** (conferencing)
- **300 transcription minutes/month**
- **300 recording minutes/month**
- **Unlimited participants**
- **Unlimited rooms**

## 🚧 Known Limitations

1. **JWT Token Generation**: Currently using mock tokens. Need to implement proper JWT signing with `github.com/golang-jwt/jwt/v5`
2. **AI Analysis**: Basic keyword matching. Should integrate OpenAI GPT-4 for production
3. **Polls/Whiteboard**: UI ready but 100ms integration pending
4. **Recording Storage**: Need to configure S3 or Cloud Storage for recordings

## 🔄 Integration with Existing Modes

Professional Mode is **completely separate** from existing 1-on-1 WebRTC and group Daily.co modes:

- **1-on-1 WebRTC**: Still works via `/room/{id}` (P2P)
- **Daily.co Groups**: Still works via `/static/group-call-daily.html`
- **Professional Mode**: New mode via `/static/professional-mode.html` (100ms)

All modes coexist without conflicts.

## 📝 Rollback Instructions

If you need to rollback to before Professional Mode:

```bash
# Checkout the safe point tag
git checkout safe-point-before-100ms

# Or by commit hash
git checkout 8f02d46
```

This will restore the codebase to the state before Professional Mode was added.

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Implement Real JWT Tokens**: Replace mock tokens with proper JWT signing
2. **Integrate OpenAI**: Replace keyword-based AI with GPT-4 analysis
3. **Add Polls**: Complete 100ms polls integration
4. **Add Whiteboard**: Integrate 100ms whiteboard plugin
5. **Recording Storage**: Configure S3/GCS for recording files
6. **Post-call Analysis**: AI summary generation after meeting ends
7. **Transcript Sharing**: Generate shareable transcript links
8. **Email Notifications**: Send meeting summaries via email
