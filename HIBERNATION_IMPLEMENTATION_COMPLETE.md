## Technical Details

### Health Check Endpoint

Located at `/api/health` (must be before "/" catch-all route)

**Request:**
```bash
curl https://messenger.kaminskyi.chat/api/health
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "status": "ready",      // "ready" or "starting"
  "redis": true,          // Redis connection status
  "sfu": true,            // SFU server initialization
  "uptime": 123.45,       // Server uptime in seconds
  "timestamp": 1759863702 // Unix timestamp
}
```

### Sleep Controller Configuration

**Default Settings:**
```bash
IDLE_TIMEOUT=3600          # 1 hour (3600 seconds)
CHECK_INTERVAL=300         # Check every 5 minutes
```

**Activity Detection:**
- Network connections on ports 80, 443, 8080
- Redis sessions (`session:*` keys)
- Redis meetings (`meeting:*` keys)
- Service status (messenger, nginx, redis)

**Shutdown Process:**
1. Redis SAVE (persist data)
2. Stop messenger service
3. Stop nginx service
4. Create wake marker with metadata
5. Sync filesystem
6. Schedule shutdown in 30 seconds

### CloudFlare Worker Configuration

**DigitalOcean API Integration:**
```javascript
const CONFIG = {
  DO_API_TOKEN: 'dop_v1_...',
  DROPLETS: {
    messenger: { id: 522123497, ip: '64.227.116.250' },
    turn: { id: 522123449, ip: '64.226.72.235' }
  }
};
```

**Wake-up Flow:**
1. Detect droplet is "off"
2. POST to `/v2/droplets/{id}/actions` with `{"type":"power_on"}`
3. Poll every 3 seconds (max 40 times = 2 minutes)
4. Check health endpoint
5. Proxy request when ready

**Loading Screen:**
- Beautiful gradient design
- Countdown timer
- Auto-refresh when ready
- Proactive health checks every 2 seconds

## Deployment Status

- [ ] Sleep controller detects activity
- [ ] Sleep controller initiates shutdown after timeout
- [ ] CloudFlare worker detects "off" status
- [ ] CloudFlare worker sends power_on command
- [ ] Loading screen displays during wake-up
- [ ] Site loads after wake-up complete

### Integration Tests
- [ ] Complete wake-up flow (off → on → ready)
- [ ] Health check during startup (starting status)
- [ ] Automatic sleep after idle period
- [ ] Redis data persistence across sleep/wake
- [ ] Multiple simultaneous wake requests

### Performance Tests
- [ ] Wake-up time (target: < 20 seconds)
- [ ] Health check response time
- [ ] CloudFlare Worker latency
- [ ] Activity detection accuracy

## Next Steps

To complete the deployment:

1. **Deploy Sleep Controller** (15 minutes)
   ```bash
   # Follow HIBERNATION_DEPLOYMENT.md Part 1
   scp sleep-controller.sh root@64.227.116.250:/usr/local/bin/
   ssh root@64.227.116.250
   # Create systemd service and start
   ```

2. **Deploy CloudFlare Worker** (10 minutes)
   ```bash
   # Follow HIBERNATION_DEPLOYMENT.md Part 2
   # Copy cloudflare-worker.js to CloudFlare dashboard
   # Configure routes and KV binding
   ```

3. **Test Complete Flow** (10 minutes)
   ```bash
   # Follow HIBERNATION_DEPLOYMENT.md Part 3
   # Manual shutdown test
   # Automatic sleep test
   # Wake-up flow test
   ```

4. **Monitor First 24 Hours** (passive)
   ```bash
   # Check logs periodically
   journalctl -u sleep-controller.service -f
   # Verify wake-ups work correctly
   ```

## Maintenance

### Daily
- No action required (fully automatic)

### Weekly
- Check CloudFlare Worker logs for errors
- Review sleep/wake cycles in droplet logs

### Monthly
- Review DigitalOcean billing for actual savings
- Adjust idle timeout if needed

### Quarterly
- Update CloudFlare Worker if needed
- Review and optimize activity detection

## Security Considerations

✅ **Implemented Security Measures:**
1. DigitalOcean API token only in CloudFlare Worker (edge)
2. Health endpoint is public but exposes no sensitive data
3. Redis SAVE before shutdown (data persistence)
4. Graceful service shutdown (no data loss)
5. Wake marker for audit trail

❌ **Not Recommended for Production:**
- Wake-up latency (15-20 seconds) not acceptable for live users
- Use hibernation only during development phase
- Disable before launching to real users

## Known Limitations

1. **Wake-up Time**: 15-20 seconds (DigitalOcean boot time)
2. **TURN Server**: Cannot proxy UDP traffic (wake-up only)
3. **First Request**: Shows loading screen
4. **Concurrent Requests**: Multiple users during wake-up all wait
5. **CloudFlare Free Tier**: 100,000 requests/day limit

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements (not implemented):

1. **Predictive Wake-up**: Wake before predicted user activity
2. **Faster Boot**: Snapshot with services pre-started
3. **Progressive Wake**: Partial service availability during boot
4. **Cost Dashboard**: Real-time savings visualization
5. **Smart Scheduling**: Different timeouts for day/night

## Conclusion

The droplet hibernation system is **ready for deployment**. The core infrastructure is complete:

- ✅ Health check endpoint working
- ✅ Sleep controller script ready
- ✅ CloudFlare Worker ready
- ✅ Comprehensive deployment guide

**Estimated Time to Deploy**: 35 minutes
**Expected Savings**: $19.20/month (80% reduction during development)
**User Impact**: 15-20 second delay on first request after sleep

Follow the deployment guide (`HIBERNATION_DEPLOYMENT.md`) to complete the setup.
