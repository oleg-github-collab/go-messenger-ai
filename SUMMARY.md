## 💡 Key Decisions Made

### 1. Archive Instead of Delete
**Decision:** Preserve all old code in `/archive/`
**Rationale:**
- Valuable learning resource
- Potential restoration if needed
- Reference for future projects
- Open-source potential

### 2. Daily.co for Group Video
**Decision:** Use Daily.co instead of self-hosted SFU
**Rationale:**
- Built-in recording & transcription
- Faster development
- Professional UI
- Better reliability
- Acceptable cost for MVP

### 3. Keep Own Audio Calls
**Decision:** Self-host 1-on-1 audio calls
**Rationale:**
- Daily.co free tier limits
- Audio is lightweight (easy P2P)
- Privacy for sensitive conversations
- Already have WebRTC expertise

### 4. Comprehensive Documentation
**Decision:** Write 80 KB of detailed docs
**Rationale:**
- Preserve knowledge
- Easy restoration
- Team onboarding
- Open-source preparation

## 📈 Cost Analysis

### Old Architecture (Archived)
```
DigitalOcean:     $24/mo
Hibernation:      -$16/mo savings
Effective:        $8/mo
```

### New Architecture (Target)
```
Railway:          $5-20/mo
Daily.co:         $0-99/mo (usage-based)
OpenAI:           $10-50/mo (transcription)
Total:            $15-169/mo (scales with usage)
```

### Break-Even Analysis
- **Current:** $8/mo (ultra-optimized, complex maintenance)
- **New (MVP):** ~$15/mo (simpler, faster development)
- **New (Scale):** ~$100/mo (1000+ hours of video/month)

**Verdict:** Worth the cost for professional features and faster development

## 🎓 Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well
✅ **Modular architecture** - Easy to separate concerns
✅ **Comprehensive docs** - Future self will appreciate
✅ **Archive strategy** - Nothing lost, everything preserved
✅ **Planning before coding** - Clear roadmap reduces confusion

### What Was Challenging
⚠️ **Complex infrastructure** - Hibernation added significant complexity
⚠️ **Custom SFU** - Great learning, but time-intensive
⚠️ **Deployment automation** - Lots of moving parts

### What We'd Do Differently
🔄 Start with Daily.co from day 1 (faster MVP)
🔄 Less complex cost optimization (hibernation overkill for MVP)
🔄 More automated testing

### What's Genius (Worth Preserving)
💡 **Hibernation system** - 86% cost reduction, brilliant engineering
💡 **Modular SFU** - Clean code, educational value
💡 **Terraform configs** - Professional IaC setup
